## About me
Im just a silly German that likes to create various tools that actually already exist, just for fun and experience.

## State of things
I have many projects I have to finish and even more projects I didnt upload yet.

Time will tell when I have uploaded all of my projects, but because I dont automatically sync them with github and Im lazy this can take up some time.
